#   This line is a COMMENT -- a note to the person reading this file.
#   When a program runs, it ignores everything from a  # (hash)  mark
#   to the end of the line with the  #  mark.
#
#   We call files that have Python code in them MODULES.
#   Line 1 of this module (above) prints (displays) the STRING
#      Hello, World
#   on the Run window (terminal).
#
#   Anything surrounded by quote marks (single or double) is a STRING.

# DONE: 1.
#   The TO-DO comment above this one indicates that there is something for
#   you to do.
#
#   Run this module by clicking the "run" button (it looks like a play 
#   button) in the top right corner of this window
#
#   After running, find the Run window (it may have opened at the bottom or
#   to the right) and confirm that
#        Hello, World
#   did indeed get printed (displayed) in that window.
#

###############################################################################
#
# DONE: 2.
#
#   Notice that TODO's turn blue even inside of comments. This helps you
#   find them easier when you are looking for what you still need to do.
#
#   When you have completed a TO-DO, you should change the word
#     _TODO_      (ignore the underscores on this line)
#   to
#     DONE
#   Try it now on line 20 above, and note that it is no longer blue.
#
#   If you change TODOs to DONEs like this, you can tell when you have
#   finished all the exercises in a module -- there will be no blue comments.
#
#   You have now completed TO-DO #2, so change its TO-DO on line 36 to DONE
#   (and proceed similarly for all forthcoming TODOs in this course).
#
#   There are also many extensions that can help you manage TODOs and comments.
#   I am currently using one called 'Better Comments' by Aaron Bond that simply
#   changes the color of certain types of comments.

#
# DONE: 3.
#   Add another   print   statement below the current Line 1 above.
#   It should print any string that you want.
#
#   Test your code by re-running this module, either by proceeding as you did
#   when you ran this module the first time by pressing the triangle "Play"
#   button that is on the toolbar at the top right of this window. Look at
#   the Run window to be sure that your string printed as expected.
#

print(3607* 34227)
###############################################################################
#
# DONE: 4.
#   Add yet another   print   statement.
#   This one should print the *product* of 3,607 and 34,227.
#   Let the computer do the arithmetic for you.
#   You do NOT have to use strings for this, so no quotation marks!
#   This is a bit of a preview for next week but see if you can figure it out
#   based on the examples in m1e. (HINT: try this operator *)
#
#   TEST your code by re-running this module, then asking someone: What number
#   did your   print   display for this TO-DO? You can also check your answer
#   with a calculator. (HINT: It is an INTERESTING number.)  Get help if your
#   value is wrong.

#
# DONE: 5.
#   Look at the list of files in the Project window (to the left).  Note that
#   this file (m2_todo_and_commit_push.py) now has a 'U' next to it.
#
#   This means that you have made changes to this file which have not yet
#   been COMMITTED to version control and PUSHED to the cloud.
#
#   COMMIT and PUSH your work by:
#     1. Select the Sourc Control tool on the very left of this window (it 
#        looks like a forked path of sorts).
#     2. Type in a commit message indicating what changes you have made.
#        "Completed m2" would be sufficient since you are done with this module.
#     2. Select  Commit  beneath the textbox.
#     3. Select  Sync Changes  which will save your changes to your GitHub repo.
#
#   COMMIT adds the changed work to the version control on your computer
#   and Sync Changes adds the changed work into your Github repository in 
#   the "cloud".
#
#   VS Code forces you to add a  Commit  message intended to describe
#   your work to teammates, but until your team project you can use very
#   simple commit messages.
#
#   Always Sync Changes (in addition to the COMMIT) so that your work is
#   backed-up in the cloud, and also so that your instructor can access it
#   as needed.
#
#   Don't forget to check your TO-DOs before you are done and always run your
#   code one last time before you are done to make sure nothing is broken.
#
#   You can COMMIT-and-PUSH as often as you like.  DO IT FREQUENTLY.
